				<p>Hello, my name is Jason Schmitz.  I am a first-year student at Johson County Community College pursuing my associateâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems.
				I graduated from Tonganoxie High School in 1996, so it has been a while since I have been in the education setting.  After graduation I started working at Hallmark Cards
				and I have worked there ever since.  Currently I am working as a Process Profiler at Hallmark, where I use my skills in the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>SAP</li>
					<li>Excel (VBA)</li>
					<li>MPPS (Hallmark based program)</li>
					<li>Legacy (Hallmark based program)</li>
					<li>Access</li>
				</ul>
				<p> These skills help me provide analytics and reporting for my area and allow us to be more successful in our day-to-day operations.  My professional goals include learning computer programing, web design, 
				and working with algorithms to move toward our IT department at Hallmark.  I have been tasked with being a team member of many of our system upgrades throughout the years, 
				and I would like to go from test to creating new system for our company.  In my personal life, the most important thing in my life is my family..... especailly my three kids!  As a single parent they have
				been my main focus for the last 15 years.  The reason why I am now going back to school is becuase they are now old enough to go on their own journey in life.</p>
